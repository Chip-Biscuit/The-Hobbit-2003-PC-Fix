# Requirements before using fix
For the fixes to work properly you must have patched the game up to 1.3 release. If you have not done so already then you can download the patch from here https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1074-the-hobbit-patches/ 

# Instructions
Go to release, download the zip file and extract it, then put the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini into your game folder next to the Meridian.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d8.ini file.

Watch the official fix guide video here on how to install the game and use the fix

# Resolution
It is advised that the resolution is changed within the pause menu options. This is due to a bug that can occur on the main menu which prevents the user from being able to change their resolution properly.

# FOV
FOV is off by default in the ini which is set to (0). The ini has 3 options to choose from in this fix, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1),(2) or (3).

# FPS
FPS can be toggled in the game, you can set whichever hotkey you wish in d3d8.ini use [hotkey]keycodes.txt to see which hex code belongs to the key you want to use and copy paste it to the d3d8.ini hotkey setting.
This will mean that you can use the key you select to toggle between 30 and 60 FPS in game at any time. default is 0x55 which is the "U" key on the keyboard.

# The Hobbit Fix
The FPS can be toggled with any key in the game. There will be a message box that will pop up before the game launches which will give you instructions on what you must do. Click OK on the first pop up message box, then click any button on your keyboard or mouse and it will then confirm the button choice and launch the game. Then in the game you can use the key you have selected to toggle between 30 and 60 FPS within the game at any time.

# The Hobbit Fix-NoMessageBox
This version has no message box asking you to choose a key before launching the game. The FPS toggle key will always be "O" on the keyboard.
